Instructions for building and publishing a new update site:

* Commit all changes

* Be sure that the JMLAnnotations, OpenJDK, OpenJML. OpenJMLUI, and Specs 
  projects are built without errors and all unit and release tests pass
** Execute the buildRelease file
** Execute the testRelease file - be sure it runs successfully
** Run the JUnit tests - be sure they run successfully

* Open OpenJMLFeature/feature.xml and choose the Overview page
** Change the version number
** Save the file (without closing it)
** Click "Synchronize" under "Exporting" on this page
** Select "Force feature..." on the pop-up dialog
** Select Finish
** Save all open files

* Open OpenJML-UpdateSite/site.xml

   make sure it is the desired version
** Click OK
** Select the new feature in the list of features
** Click 'Build' (NOT 'Build All')
** Verify that the new version of the feature is in OpenJML-UpdateSite/features
   and the new versions of the plug-ins (3 of them) are in 
   OpenJML-UpdateSite/plugins
** Save all open files
** Commit all changes
   
* Push the new feature to the website as follows
** Re-run the build-release so it is built with the current version information
** In a bash shell, in directory OpenJML-UpdateSite
** If you are not David Cok, edit the web/toSF script to use your sourceforge 
   user name
** Run the script web/toSF (you will need to enter your sourceforge password)

Note that there are four sets of files that might be uploaded:
 * a) the html files constituting the OpenJML specs web site (quick)
 * b) the OpenJML release file and the most recent plug-in files (takes a while)
 * c) plug-in files for previous releases (takes quite a while)
 * d) the project files under the 'Files' category of the sourceforge pages for
      the JML project (takes a while, but less than b)

Different scripts in OpenJML-UpdateSite/web update different combinations of 
the files above:
 * toSF : (the usual update) - does (a), (b), (d)
 * toSFweb : (use for quick updates to the web pages) - does (a) only
 * toSFproject : does (d) only
 * toSFall : does all four
