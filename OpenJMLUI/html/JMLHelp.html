<H2><A NAME="Overview">Overview</A></H2>
<P>
This plug-in provides Java Modeling Language
(<A HREF="http://org.jmlspecs.org/">JML</A>)
functionality as an Eclipse plug-in into the Java development environment of Eclipse.
The JML plug-in
in particular provides functionality for checking and manipulating formal specifications
of Java programs. The plug-in works with Eclipse 4.2 (tested with 4.2.1); the 
back-end OpenJML tool supports Java versions through 
OpenJDK 7.

<p>
<B>Licensing:</B> 
The plug-in builds on the Eclipse JDT and PDE, through their public interfaces;
it does not modify or contribute to Eclipse itself. 
The source for the plug-in is available at the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmlspecs/"> jmlspecs sourceforge project</A>.
This version of the plug-in is offered without cost and without warranty of any kind.  
Feedback that will
improve its usefulness is welcome.  
This version of the plug-in is distributed under the 
<A HREF=http://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php>Eclipse Public License</A>.
The copyright is retained by the primary author.  
Future versions may use other licenses.
The underlying OpenJML tool is built on 
<A HREF="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</A> 
(OpenJDK is a trademark of Oracle).
OpenJDK and thus OpenJML is licensed under 
<A HREF="http://openjdk.java.net/legal/">GPL</A>.
    

<P>
The plug-in adds the following functionality to Eclipse's Java Perspective:
<UL>
<LI>A menubar item labeled 'JML' with a number of submenu items that
invoke various tools and manage the environment.
<LI>Toolbar items labeled with the JML yellow coffee cup icon that invokes the JML syntax and type checker,
with 'ESC' to invoke static checking, and with 'RAC to invoke runtime assertion compilation.
<LI>Problem markers: a red, yellow, orange and blue disks with a 'J' on then for JML problems,
JML warnings, JML static checking (ESC) warnings, and JML informational messages, respectively.
These must be enabled in the Filters menu of the Problems view (they may be
disabled by default).
<LI>Annotation preferences.  On the General>Editors>TextEditors>Annotations
preference page are four new categories for the four new problem markers.  This 
preference page contains controls for determining whether and how editor annotations 
are displayed in editors - e.g. as squigglies, in the overview ruler (on the right),
in the vertical ruler (on the left), and in what color.
<LI>Context menu items in various views 
and on Java editors that replicate some
of the above menu items for Java Projects, source
folders, packages, compilation
units, working sets, and individual classes and methods.
<LI>The plug-in recognizes the standard JML file suffix (e.g. .jml);
this suffix is bound to the Java editor.  JML annotations themselves, however, are
still treated as comments by the Java editor.
<!-- TODO: An editor with syntax checking -->
<LI>A console page to which output from the JML operations is sent.
<LI>An OpenJML preferences page 
(under Window &gt;&gt; Preferences &gt;&gt; OpenJML).
<LI>A JML builder that is visible (when the JML Nature is enabled) 
in the Project Properties Builders page.
<LI>A decoration visible in the package explorer (and other places)
on Java Projects with autochecking enabled.  There is a toggle
named 'JML' to enable these decorations in the Label Decorations page of
the workbench preferences.
<LI>Ability to generate javadoc documentation with JML material included.
<LI>A new category of commands in the Workbench &gt;&gt; Keys page of the Eclipse
preferences.  The category is named 'JML' and allows key bindings to be 
defined for the various new menu actions. 
<LI>A Help document describing the JML plug-in functionality available
through the Help &gt;&gt; HelpContents menu (this document).
<!-- TODO: refactorings, e.g. renaming; editing of combined specs all at once; search and navigation in the JML expressions -->
</UL>

Besides the additions to the Eclipse UI, there is also a JML command-line tool
that can be executed outside Eclipse; the Eclipse UI simply drives the 
command-line tool to do the type and static checking of JML specifications.

<H2><A name="Installation">Installation</A></H2>

<P>
The plug-in is installed, updated, and uninstalled from Eclipse in the 
standard way. The update site site containing the plug-in is
http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite. 
<!--  
    <ul>
     <li> Start Eclipse.
     <li> Open the dialog at Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Find and Install.
     <li> Choose "Search for new features to install" and "Next&gt;".
     <li> Select "New Remote Site".  Fill in the dialog with the name "JML"
          and the URL "???", and press "OK". <!-- FIXME -- >
     <li> Select "JML" in the list of sites to search and press "Next&gt;".
     <li> If all is well, the available versions of the plug-in will be displayed;
          select the most recent JML version and press "Next&gt;".  
     <li> Read and accept the license terms, and press "Next&gt;".
     <LI> Choose the local installation site into which you want to install the plug-in
          (or add a new one for experimentation); then press 'Finish'.  You will likely
          be asked to restart the workspace, which you should do, otherwise the menu
          items may not appear.
     <LI> Within the file system, find the installation site plugins directory,
          and set all of the Simplify* files to have executable permission.
          (As of version 1.1.1, this should be taken care of automatically when
          the Simplify executable is first used, but it is best if the installer
          fixes the permissions at install time.)
     <LI> The plug-in will be available from any newly opened workspace from this
          installation site.
     <LI> The plug-in can be disabled or uninstalled 
          using Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Manage Configuration.
    </ul>
</p>
<P>
If you simply want to update a previous installation of JML,
then do the following:
<UL>
     <LI> Open an Eclipse workspace and choose Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Find and Install.
     <LI> Choose "Search for updates..." and "Next&gt;"
     <LI> Select the feature version to install and "Next&gt;"
     <LI> Read and accept the license terms, and press "Next&gt;".
     <LI> Choose the local installation site into which you want to install the plug-in
          (or add a new one for experimentation); then press 'Finish'.  You will likely
          be asked to restart the workspace, which you should do.
     <LI> The updated plug-in will be available from any newly opened workspace from this
          installation site. <!-- FIXME - verify the above -- >
</UL>
<P>In order to uninstall the plugin, do the following:
<UL>
<LI> Choose Help &gt;&gt; Software Updates &gt;&gt; Manage Configuration
<LI> Click the + symbol by the install location from which you wish to uninstall the plugin
<LI> Choose the JML feature from the list of installed features
<LI> Select Uninstall in the right hand panel
<LI> Confirm the Uninstall and restart the workbench
</UL>
-->

<P>
Once installed, there are a few setup actions that the user needs to
do to avoid becoming confused later on. FIXME - these may now be moot.
<UL>
<LI><B>Enable the JML markers</B> - By default new marker types
are not displayed in the 'Problems' View.  To correct this, open
the 'Problems' View (typically in the lower right pane in a Java
Perspective), and then open the 'Filter' dialog using the toolbar
item or the menu on the right end of the Problems view's toolbar.
Make sure that the 'JML Warning' entry is checked.

<LI>Be sure the <B>JML Label Decorations</B> are turned on in the 
Label Decorations page of the Workbench preferences.
<LI>Optionally define any desired <B>key bindings</B> for the various menu actions.
Use the JML category in the Keys page of the Workbench preferences to do this.
Add the key bindings to be effective in Windows or in Dialogs &amp; Windows.
<LI>Other preferences relevant to the JML plug-in may be set on the
<B>JML preferences page</B>.  (The preferences page is
obtained from the Window &gt;&gt; Preferences menu item.)
</UL>
<P>
There is one other important action that is taken care of automatically
but that the user should be aware of.
<UL>

<LI><B>JML specifications for the Java system and JML Model classes</B> - To use
JML (or other JML-based tools) effectively, the tool needs to reference a
copy of the JML specifications for the Java system classes.  A copy of these
is contained in the JML plug-in.  When a project is enabled for
JML checking, a specification project (named JmlSpecs) is automatically
created and added to the workspace.  This project contains a link to the 
library of system specifications; the project is also added to the classpath
of the enabled project, so that the specifications are seen when individual
files are checked.
<P>
You may need to adjust the position of the specifications in the classpath.
<P>
If you have other versions of the system specifications (or other sets 
of specifications for other libraries), you can conveniently add them
to your Java Projects by ...
<!-- TODO - FIXME
using the JML &gt;&gt; Setup &gt;&gt; Link in Specs Library 
menu item.  This allows you the choice of adding a set of specifications
as either a stand-alone project or as a new source folder in a 
specific project.  Using a standalone project makes it easier to 
share the specs among multiple projects and to toggle the use of the
specs on and off within a given project.
-->

</UL>


<H2><A name="General_comments">General comments</A></H2>
<P>
Here are some aspects to be aware of in using the plug-in.
<UL>
<LI>
The JML functionality is provided by the OpenJML application.
<LI>
Defining the Java Editor as the editor for the specification file suffixes
goes only part of the way towards convenient handling of specification files within
Eclipse.  In particular, one difficulty is that editing specification files 
will not trigger an
incremental compilation. <!-- [correct? other difficulties? - FIXME]. -->
<LI>Various features of the plug-in are enabled by default. If for some
reason they are or become disabled, the user may be confused that some
functionality is not visible. These features include
<UL>
<LI>JML problems in the problems view are visible only if "JML Problem" and "JML Static Check Problem"
are enabled in the currently active filter.
<LI>JML decorations on project icons are visible only if "JML" is enabled
on the General &gt;&gt; Appearance &gt;&gt; Label Decorations preference page.
<LI>JML annotations are visible within Java editors only if the appropriate
controls are set on the General &gt;&gt; Editors &gt;&gt; Text Editors &gt;&gt; Annotations
preference page.  The colors of the annotations are also controlled here. The colors
of the 'J' icons are fixed.
<LI>The OpenJML tool needs access to SMT solvers in order to do static checking.
These are set on the JML Preferences page or in the openjml.properties file.
<LI>Key bindings to JML commands are set on the General &gt;&gt; Keys preference page.
No key bindings are set by default.
<LI>Automatic type-checking of JML specifications is enabled by adding
the JML nature to a project using the provided menu action.  In addition,
the JML Builder must be enabled in the project properties; the JML builder
is enabled by default when the JML Nature is added, but it is possible for
a user (or, possibly, other plug-ins) to disable it.  Automatic type-checking
is not enabled by default, but is persistent. Only type-checking (not 
static checking) is able to be automatic.
<LI>JML type and static checking apply to the <I>saved</I> version of a 
source file.
<LI>Java refactorings (e.g. renaming) are currently not aware of JML information.
<LI>Other tool options are set on the JML preference page.
</UL>
<LI>
The Eclipse framework operates on projects one by one.  This is 
required because attributes such as the relevant classpath for
compiling the project may differ from project to project.  Hence
JML tools driven by Eclipse must also operate project by project; this is ordinarily
not a problem but can in some circumstances lead to slow or 
undesirable results.  This problem is avoided if everything that
can be compiled with a given classpath is contained in one project,
with one output bin directory,
possibly using multiple source folders.
<LI>
Internal errors or unexpected exceptional situations are logged in 
Eclipse's error log.  The JML page of the Eclipse Console
 may be used to report progress and general debugging information, if
 that output is enabled in the JML preferences page.
</UL>

TBD

<H2><A NAME="#Menus">Menu and toolbar functionality</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="#Menubar">Menubar and submenu actions</A></H3>

The top menubar provides the following functionality.  The toolbar
and the context menus replicate some of this functionality.  The menubar
item is labeled 'JML'.
<P>
Each of the menu operations act on the currently selected set of objects
as appropriate for that operation.
If an editor is selected and active, the operation will apply to the
one Java compilation unit in that editor.  If a WorkingSet is selected, it will
apply to the Java Projects in that Working Set.
In Eclipse's Package Explorer view, multiple items may
be selected.  The operations will act appropriately on 
each selected Java Project, container or file.
Selecting a container item will cause
the relevant operation to be performed on all the items within the 
container.  Currently, selecting a Java element within a file (e.g. a method)
does not result in any operation, though some appropriate action may be
implemented in the future.
</P>
<H4><A NAME="#Checks"></A>Type Checking JML</H4>
This operation type-checks the JML in each selected item or its contents.
The operation can be initiated from the menu item or by the the yellow coffee 
cup toolbar item or from various context menus.
<P>
Any JML syntax or parsing errors are presented as problem markers.  
How problems are identified depends on the preferences set in 
General&gt;Editors&gt;Text Editors&gt;Annotations. These items can be set or
their colors changed:
<UL>
<LI> showing problems by underlining with squigglies
<LI> showing problems by highlighting
<LI> showing problems by an icon in the left (vertical) ruler
<LI> showing problems by marks in the right (overview) ruler
</UL>
In addition problems are shown in the Problems View, if enabled by the content
selection for the Problems View.
<P>
  If
problems are enabled in the Problems View, then details of the problem
are shown in the Problems View.  This menu item performs
a check whether or not the project is enabled for automatic checking.
It operates on the saved version of the source file, 
not the current edited but unsaved version.
<!-- FIXME someday -->
<P>
A JML Check operation needs to parse files other than those selected
if they are referenced by the selected files.  Thus errors may be
detected (and markers produced) in files other than those selected.
<!-- FIXME someday-->
<P>
Prior to executing the checking operation, all markers are cleared 
from the selected files, so that a fresh set of error reports is
available.  However, non-selected files are not cleared, which may
result in multiple markers being produced for problems in other files.
Also, if the error is subsequently corrected but the file with the marker is
not selected when the JML Checker is run again, the marker will not be
cleared even though the problem is no longer present. An occasional 
type-check of an entire project is a quick way to solve this problem.
Alternately all problem JML markers can be cleared, so they are all created
afreash.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="#StaticChecks"></A>Static Checking JML</H4>
The Static Check operation is available as a menu item, toolbar item, and in
the context menus of various Java elements. It checks for each method in the
selected set of Java elements whether the method's implementation is consistent
with its specification. Warnings about possible inconsistencies are displayed
as JML Static Check Problems, in the conventional way Eclipse problems are
displayed. The icon in the left ruler is an orange disc with a J.


<H4><A NAME="#Clear"></A>Delete JML Markers</H4>
The Delete Markers operation removes all problem markers from any selected 
files or
containers.


<H4><A NAME="#Enable"></A>Enable JML auto checking</H4>
Enabling the JML
autochecker will install the JML Nature on the project and enable the
automatic builder.  Then after any compilation (even an incremental compilation),
the JML checker will be run on any newly saved compilation units of the project.
The checker will be run on the entire project immediately upon enabling the
automatic builder.  This menu item is also available on WorkingSets in the
Package Navigator; when activated, it applies to all of the Java projects in the
working set.  The auto checker is enabled or disabled only on Java Projects, not
on components of projects.


<H4><A NAME="#Disable"></A>Disable JML auto checking</H4>
This menu action disables the JML automatic checking for a project.  
The menu item is also available on WorkingSets, in which case it applies to
all of the Java Projects in the working set.
The auto checker is enabled or disabled only on Java Projects, not
on components of projects.
<P>
Note that you can also disable automatic checking on the Builders page of the
Project &gt;&gt; Properties menu item, without removing the JML Nature of 
the project.
This action is discouraged.
  
<H4><A NAME="#ProofInfo"></A>Show Proof Information</H4>

<H4><A NAME="#DeleteRAC"></A>Delete RAC class files</H4>

TBD

<H3><A NAME="#Toolbar"></A>Toolbar</H3>

The tool bar contains three additions:
<UL>
<LI>A yellow coffee cup icon: this button performs JML type-checking on
selected files, 
the same operation as the JML type-check menu action.
<LI>ESC: this button performs static checking of selected files, the
same operation as the Static Check menu item
<LI>RAC: this button performs assertion compiling, the same operation as
the RAC menu item
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="#ContextMenu"></A>Context menus</H3>

There are JML specific items added to the context menus in various views such 
as the Package Explorer, Navigator and Outline views.
Context menus are obtained by right-clicking (Control+Click in MacOS) on the 
desired item.
In each case the functionality is the same as for the corresponding menubar item,
but the operation applies only to the item right-clicked upon.  Multiple items 
can be selected (using shift-click or control-click) and operated
on at once using the context menu, but the context menu item will be disabled 
if an item is selected to which the menu item does not apply 
(even in a group of other items to which the menu item does apply).

<A NAME="#EnableSelected"/>
<H4>Enable JML in SELECTED projects</H4>
This operation will install JML and add the builders, specifications, and 
runtime library in any project that is
selected (or has an element that is selected).  If a project is already
enabled, no action occurs.  Note that the builders are always added in
default mode (checker and RAC enabled, jmldoc disabled) regardless of 
any previous state.  A decoration appears on the Project icon in
the Package Explorer indicating that the project has JML installed.
<A NAME="#DisableSelected"/>
<H4>Disable JML in SELECTED projects</H4> 
This operation will disable JML and remove the builders from any project that is
selected (or has an element that is selected).  If a project is already
disabled, no action occurs.   Specifications and the runtime library will remain.
<A NAME="#EnableAll"/>
<H4>Enable JML in ALL projects</H4>
Enables JML as described above for all Java projects (but not necessarily for new ones),
ignoring any selection.
<A NAME="#DisableAll"/>
<H4>Disable JML in ALL projects</H4>
Disables JML as described above for all Java projects, ignoring any selection.
<A NAME="#LinkSpecs"/>
<H4>Link in Specs library...</H4>
The default specifications library is inserted into JML-enabled projects
automatically.  This menu item allows the user to perform this task 
manually or to add to a project a different set of specifications.  There 
are two ways to add specifications to a project.
<UL>
<LI><B>As a project</B>:  In this case (the easier to work with), the specifications
will appear in a new project of their own and the project will be added to
the classpath of any selected Java projects.  Leave
the check box ("Link in as project") checked, choose a name for the project
that is to contain the specs and a name for the source folder within
the project.  The project name must be one that you will not use for
other purposes; the folder name can be any legal source folder name.
Then type in or browse to the file system location of the specifications
that you want to make available to the project.  These must be in source 
file, not jar, format.  Select 'OK'.  You may also want to adjust the
oder of items in the classpath in the project's properties ('JavaBuild Path' page, 
'Order and Export' tab).  If you like, you may also add other specification
libraries to the new project.
<LI><B>As a source folder</B>: In this case the selected projects will
each be modified by the addition of a new source folder within the project that will be linked
to the file system location of the specifications.  Uncheck the
toggle marked "Link in as project".  The project name is ignored; choose
a source folder name that will not conflict with other source folders
that you have or will create in the selected projects.  Type in or
browse to the file-system location of the specifications you wish to 
use.  Select 'OK' and adjust, if necessary, the order of items in the

<H2><A NAME="#Preferences"></A>JML preferences</H2>
The plug-in provides a new preference page under Window&gt;&gt;Preferences; it is
contained under the 'JML' heading.
All the items in the JML preferences page are global to all 
Java projects.  
<P>
TBD - FIXME - This needs rewriting.
<!-- 
<H3><A NAME="#EclipseOptions"></A>Options for JML-Eclipse</H3>
This group of options does not affect JML per se.  Rather they control 
aspects of the plug-in.
<P>
<B>Enable Eclipse informational messages.</B> 
Enabling this option turns on printing of 
progress and debug messages relating to the operation
of the plug-in itself. (Default is off.) Errors and warnings are always displayed.
<P>
<B>Log to the Eclipse console.</B>
Error and informational output from the plug-in
can be directed to one of two places, depending on the
status of this toggle.  If the toggle is checked (the default),
progress and debug output is sent to the Eclipse console of the instance
of Eclipse that is running the program being executed.  If the toggle
is not checked, then the output is sent to <code>System.out</code>.  Depending
on the way in which Eclipse was started, this output may end up in the
terminal from which Eclipse was started, the console of a parent
Eclipse process, or may be lost entirely.
<P>
<B>Send informational output to the log file also.</B>
When unchecked (the default), only error output is recorded in the system
log file (as seen in Eclipse's Error Log view).  By enabling this option,
informational output is also logged in the log and can be seen in the Error
Log view.  Normally this simply clutters up the Error Log, but it can be helpful
in some situations to capture all of the output in one place.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="#JMLOptions"></A>Options related to JML</H3>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Java source version.</B>
Use this option to specify the version of Java source code that is being used.
Using version "1.4" enables the <code>assert</code> identifier to be treated as
a keyword and for the assert statement to be interpreted as specified by Java.
Using "1.5" enables all of the Java 5.0 (1.5) language enhancements [which are
not yet implemented in JML.]
The default is version 1.4.  (<code>-source</code> option)
</P><P>
<B>Behavior of assert statement.</B>
Use this option to define the behavior of Java 1.4 assert statements.  The options
are to ignore assert statements, to treat them as Java statements (the default),
 or to convert
them to JML assertions.<!-- FIXME - what option -- >
</P>

<H2><A NAME="#Features"></A>Other Features</H2> 
<H3><A NAME="#Markers"></A>JML Problem Markers</H3>
<P>
The plug-in defines two new types of Problem marker that is used to indicate
syntax errors or warnings about potential specification violations
that the JML tool finds.  The marker icon is a 
white 'J' superimposed on a dot.  The icon is shown in the ruler along the
left edge of Java editors at the line where a problem is identified.  Tooltip
information, shown when the mouse pointer remains steady over the icon for a short
period of time, gives details of the problem. 
<UL>
<LI>red dot - JML syntax error
<LI>orange dot - Static checking warning
<LI>yellow dot - JML syntax warning
<LI>blue dot - JML informational message
</UL>
</P><P>
The 
details of the problem are also shown in the Problems View.  Note that the Problems 
View has a filter that chooses which types of problems are to be shown.  The
JML problem type is NOT shown by default and must be enabled in the 
filters menu of the Problems View.  (The filters menu is found by selecting either
the Filters icon or the down-arrow Menu icon in the upper right corner of the
Problems View).  [  FIXME - is it still true that the markers are not shown by defzault?]
</P>
<H3><A NAME="#Console"></A>JML Console</H3>
The Eclipse Console View is available to plug-ins to show textual output from
plug-in tools.  The Console has a number of panes.  The JML plug-in adds
a new pane, called 'JML', to which output from the JML plug-in or
tool is sent.  The Console view generally automatically switches to the pane
with recent output, but on some occasions the user may have to choose the
pane manually to see the JML output. (The Console can also be pinned to
disable automatic switching.)
<H3><A NAME="#Context"></A>Context Menus</H3>
The context menu in the Package Navigator (obtained with a right mouse press over
an item in the Package Navigator tree hierarchy) has menu options pertinent
to the context in which the menu is invoked.  These actions are equivalent
to those in the menubar.
<H3><A NAME="#Builder"></A>JML Automatic Builder</H3>
When JML is enabled for a project
(e.g. by the JML &gt;&gt; Setup &gt;&gt; Enable JML menu item), then 
a new Incremental Builder becomes available on the Project's
Builders Properties page.  Once present, the builders can be 
enabled and disabled on the Builders page.
<P>
When the 'JML AutoCheck' Builder is enabled, then whenever compilation
takes place within a project, all files in that project are JML-type-checked
after being compiled.
Success or failure of this checking is shown by the presence of 
JML markers
in each file, just as errors from the Java compiler are show by Java Problem markers.
</P><P>
Enabling auto checking will cause Eclipse to immediately run a compilation
cycle on that project.
</P><P>
Note that changing the options on the JML preferences page does not
constitute changing the file and will not provoke an incremental
recompilation (and JML rechecking) of the files.  Instead, if you
change the JML options (when you have auto checking enabled), you should
do a clean rebuild of the files (or a gratuitous edit and save within them).
Be sure to save any edited files, or have 'Save automatically before build'
enabled on the Workbench Preferences page (from the Window&gt;&gt;Preferences menu item). 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="#Decorators"></A>JML Label Decorations</H3>
The plug-in adds a new label decoration to the Eclipse framework.  
Label Decorators can be
enabled or disabled on the Workbench&gt;&gt;Label Decorations page of the
workbench Preferences.  When enabled here, a decoration may be shown on
icons in the Package Explorer view.
The decoration is a miniscule version of the JML logo (a mostly yellow coffee cup);
it appears as an Upper Right
overlay for Java Projects that have JML enabled.
 (It lies on top of the
blue J indicating a Java Project.)

<H3><A NAME="#Commands"></A>JML Key Bindings</H3>
The 'Keys' page of the Workbench preferences allows the user to 
associate key bindings with any 
command.  There is a JML category of commands.  
No key bindings are defined by default, but the
user may choose to add some.  Make sure they are enabled for 'Windows'
or 'Dialogs and Windows'.

<H3><A NAME="#Help"></A>JML Help</H3>
Help information (this document) is available through the Help menu.
Select the Help menu item on the menubar and the 'Help Contents'
sub-menu item.  One of the help topics shown is 'JML'.   Selecting
that topic will bring up this JML Help document.
<P>
In addition all the various toolbar and dialog box controls have tool tip
information that gives a bit more explanation of the purpose of the item.
