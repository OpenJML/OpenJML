/** Common protocol of the JML model collection types.

 * The use of elementType and containsNull in this specification
 * follows the ESC/Java specification of {@link java.util.Collection}.
 * That is, these ghost fields are used by the user of the object to
 * state what types of objects are allowed to be added to the collection,
 * and hence what is guaranteed to be retrieved from the collection.  They
 * are not adjusted by methods based on the content of the collection.
