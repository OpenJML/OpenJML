/**
 * A byte buffer.
 *
 * <p> This class defines six categories of operations upon
 * byte buffers:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #get() <i>get</i>} and
 *   {@link #put(byte) <i>put</i>} methods that read and write
 *   single bytes; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Relative {@link #get(byte[]) <i>bulk get</i>}
 *   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from this buffer
 *   into an array; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Relative {@link #put(byte[]) <i>bulk put</i>}
 *   methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from a
 *   byte array or some other byte
 *   buffer into this buffer; </p></li>
 *

 *
 *   <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #getChar() <i>get</i>}
 *   and {@link #putChar(char) <i>put</i>} methods that read and
 *   write values of other primitive types, translating them to and from
 *   sequences of bytes in a particular byte order; </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> Methods for creating <i><a href="#views">view buffers</a></i>,
 *   which allow a byte buffer to be viewed as a buffer containing values of
 *   some other primitive type; and </p></li>
 *

 *
 *   <li><p> Methods for {@link #compact compacting}, {@link
 *   #duplicate duplicating}, and {@link #slice slicing}
 *   a byte buffer.  </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> Byte buffers can be created either by {@link #allocate
 * <i>allocation</i>}, which allocates space for the buffer's
 *

 *
 * content, or by {@link #wrap(byte[]) <i>wrapping</i>} an
 * existing byte array  into a buffer.
 *







 *

 *
 * <a name="direct"></a>
 * <h2> Direct <i>vs.</i> non-direct buffers </h2>
 *
 * <p> A byte buffer is either <i>direct</i> or <i>non-direct</i>.  Given a
 * direct byte buffer, the Java virtual machine will make a best effort to
 * perform native I/O operations directly upon it.  That is, it will attempt to
 * avoid copying the buffer's content to (or from) an intermediate buffer
 * before (or after) each invocation of one of the underlying operating
 * system's native I/O operations.
 *
 * <p> A direct byte buffer may be created by invoking the {@link
 * #allocateDirect(int) allocateDirect} factory method of this class.  The
 * buffers returned by this method typically have somewhat higher allocation
 * and deallocation costs than non-direct buffers.  The contents of direct
 * buffers may reside outside of the normal garbage-collected heap, and so
 * their impact upon the memory footprint of an application might not be
 * obvious.  It is therefore recommended that direct buffers be allocated
 * primarily for large, long-lived buffers that are subject to the underlying
 * system's native I/O operations.  In general it is best to allocate direct
 * buffers only when they yield a measureable gain in program performance.
 *
 * <p> A direct byte buffer may also be created by {@link
 * java.nio.channels.FileChannel#map mapping} a region of a file
 * directly into memory.  An implementation of the Java platform may optionally
 * support the creation of direct byte buffers from native code via JNI.  If an
 * instance of one of these kinds of buffers refers to an inaccessible region
 * of memory then an attempt to access that region will not change the buffer's
 * content and will cause an unspecified exception to be thrown either at the
 * time of the access or at some later time.
 *
 * <p> Whether a byte buffer is direct or non-direct may be determined by
 * invoking its {@link #isDirect isDirect} method.  This method is provided so
 * that explicit buffer management can be done in performance-critical code.
 *
 *
 * <a name="bin"></a>
 * <h2> Access to binary data </h2>
 *
 * <p> This class defines methods for reading and writing values of all other
 * primitive types, except <tt>boolean</tt>.  Primitive values are translated
 * to (or from) sequences of bytes according to the buffer's current byte
 * order, which may be retrieved and modified via the {@link #order order}
 * methods.  Specific byte orders are represented by instances of the {@link
 * ByteOrder} class.  The initial order of a byte buffer is always {@link
 * ByteOrder#BIG_ENDIAN BIG_ENDIAN}.
 *
 * <p> For access to heterogeneous binary data, that is, sequences of values of
 * different types, this class defines a family of absolute and relative
 * <i>get</i> and <i>put</i> methods for each type.  For 32-bit floating-point
 * values, for example, this class defines:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * float  {@link #getFloat()}
 * float  {@link #getFloat(int) getFloat(int index)}
 *  void  {@link #putFloat(float) putFloat(float f)}
 *  void  {@link #putFloat(int,float) putFloat(int index, float f)}</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p> Corresponding methods are defined for the types <tt>char</tt>,
 * <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, and <tt>double</tt>.  The index
 * parameters of the absolute <i>get</i> and <i>put</i> methods are in terms of
 * bytes rather than of the type being read or written.
 *
 * <a name="views"></a>
 *
 * <p> For access to homogeneous binary data, that is, sequences of values of
 * the same type, this class defines methods that can create <i>views</i> of a
 * given byte buffer.  A <i>view buffer</i> is simply another buffer whose
 * content is backed by the byte buffer.  Changes to the byte buffer's content
 * will be visible in the view buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers'
 * position, limit, and mark values are independent.  The {@link
 * #asFloatBuffer() asFloatBuffer} method, for example, creates an instance of
 * the {@link FloatBuffer} class that is backed by the byte buffer upon which
 * the method is invoked.  Corresponding view-creation methods are defined for
 * the types <tt>char</tt>, <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, and
 * <tt>double</tt>.
 *
 * <p> View buffers have three important advantages over the families of
 * type-specific <i>get</i> and <i>put</i> methods described above:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *   <li><p> A view buffer is indexed not in terms of bytes but rather in terms
 *   of the type-specific size of its values;  </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> A view buffer provides relative bulk <i>get</i> and <i>put</i>
 *   methods that can transfer contiguous sequences of values between a buffer
 *   and an array or some other buffer of the same type; and  </p></li>
 *
 *   <li><p> A view buffer is potentially much more efficient because it will
 *   be direct if, and only if, its backing byte buffer is direct.  </p></li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The byte order of a view buffer is fixed to be that of its byte buffer
 * at the time that the view is created.  </p>
 *

*











*








 *

 * <h2> Invocation chaining </h2>

 *
 * <p> Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
 * specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
 * method invocations to be chained.
 *

 *
 * The sequence of statements
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * bb.putInt(0xCAFEBABE);
 * bb.putShort(3);
 * bb.putShort(45);</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * can, for example, be replaced by the single statement
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * bb.putInt(0xCAFEBABE).putShort(3).putShort(45);</pre></blockquote>
