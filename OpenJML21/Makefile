#### Additions for building OpenJML in the GitHub actions

## This Makefile assumes that the OpenJML, JMLAnnotations, Specs, openjml.github.io, OpenJML_Demo, Solvers
## repos are cloned into sibling folders under one common folder
## I expect this Makefile and auxiliary scrip0ts to fail if there are spaces in folder and file paths

## A temporary folder (relative to the location of the Makefile) used to stage materials in assembling a release
TEMP=release-temp

## A temporary folder (relative to the location of the Makefile) used to stage materials in assembling jmlruntime.jar
## Must be a simple name, not a multi-segment path
TEMPLIB=templib

## A permanent folder that holds auxiliary material to be included in a release
RELFILES=release-files

## Used in the github build.yml action

## Builds a full release. Modify (and commit) ../version.txt to set the version number builtin to the release
## Note that the openjml.zip file produced by a release is specific to a particular machine architecture
