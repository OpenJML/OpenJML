This is a release of the openjml tool.

The release is installed by unzipping the release file as downloaded from github
into an empty folder of the user's choice. All files in the release must be left 
in the same relative location with respect to each other.

The 'openjml' bash script is the executable to run; the -? option gives
help information and the OpenJML User Guide gives information about running 
the tool. On Mac systems, you may need to execute the `mac-setup` script 
so that the Mac OS security allows openjml and its libraries to run.

The 'openjml-java' script runs the OpenJML version of java -- which has the 
OpenJML runtime libraries (jmlruntime.jar) included.

Some demo examples are contained in the demos subdirectory.
More will be added over time.

See openjml.org and github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML for additional information.
