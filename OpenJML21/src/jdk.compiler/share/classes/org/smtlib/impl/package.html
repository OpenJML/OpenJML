This package is an implementation of the interfaces defined in org.smtlib.
This implementation uses the conventional concrete syntax.  
In particular, there are implementations of ISort, IPos (and ISource),
ICommand, IResponse, IExpr and its subtypes, along with factories
for all of these concrete classes.
