This package contains the main classes and abstract interfaces for this
SMT-LIB tool; the tool provides a stand-alone SMT-LIB-compliant command-line 
application, an application that responds to SMT-LIB commands over a
network port, and an SMT-LIB Java API.  For a tool that encapsulates this functionality as an 
Eclipse plug-in, see the companion package org.smtlib.plugin.
