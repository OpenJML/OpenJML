This package implements various instances of org.smtlib.ISolver, which are
specific solvers that wrap and interact with various off-the-shelf SMT solvers
currently available.  The available solvers are not necessarily SMT-LIB compliant; the wrappers implemented in this package translate to and from the given
SMT solvers, so as to present an SMT-LIB-compliant interface to the user,
while using the solving capability of the solver itself.
