<BODY>
This package contains implementations of the SMT-LIB commands,
implementing the interfaces defined in ICommand;
these implementations are independent of the concrete syntax that might 
be used, except that each command object has methods that can parse or print
representations of the command in the standard (or potentially other) concrete syntaxes.
