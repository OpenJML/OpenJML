/**
 * A prover can be used to check if a formula is satisfiable,
 * given a set of assumptions. The prover may need to be restarted
 * before being reused.
 * <P>
 * The assume calls take a JCExpression encoding the logical expression
 * that the prover is to assume.  This is a OpenJDK AST but of restricted
 * form.  In particular, only the following AST nodes are allowed (there is
 * no runtime check of this restriction):
 * <UL>
 * <LI>JCBinary - with any Java operator
 * <LI>JmlBinary - with any JML operator
 * <LI>JCUnary - with any Java operator
 * <LI>JCIdent - the identifier for a logical variable, with the
 *      type field giving the Java type of the variable
 * <LI>JCConditional - an if-then-else (i.e. ?:) construct
 * <LI>JmlBBFieldAccess - encodes field access (replaces JCFieldAccess)
 * <LI>JmlBBArrayAccess - array access, replacing JCArrayAccess
 * <LI>JCParens - not needed but helps to keep pretty printed expressions less confusing
 * <LI>JCLiteral - for boolean, integer, null literals
 * <LI>JCMethodInvocation - FIXME - needs explanation
 * </UL>
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * TODO add properties, like timelimit
