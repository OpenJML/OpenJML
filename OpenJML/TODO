Recent issues:
- Cannot obtain CLASSPATH from environment when using -jar format
- pure on a constructor
- covariant returns
- no \lbl in quantified statements

Old Notes
- have a content type for file associations
- check marker annotation specification
- popoup menu
- View actions
- check that anything in a signals_only clause is in the throws clause
- omit private fields when reading class files
- default signals_only
- adding to throws list
- test Integer.TYPE
- interning of strings
- search algorithm for .java and .jml files
- using optional spec keys to combine different versions of specs
- \same
- \else
- JML.informally vs. Informal.informally
- effective precondition must imply hidden precondition
- (DMZLoop example) - write loop invariants so that the initialization of loop variables for the first iteration does not have to be expressed in the invariants
- (CashMAountPrivate2) - can we allow multiplying and dividing by constants without needing fullblown nonlinear arithmetic
- (BaDCast) handle getClass()
- review Z3 on Mac
- test missing model methods in RAC; also missing ghost variables
- counterexample values

OLD notes - documentation
- OpenJML trac page

OLD notes - demo
- visibility
- vvalues of pure methods - OK
- colors of pre/post conditions
- method call in \old

OLD Notes - usability
- warn about no configured solvers
- Singleton's configuration checker
- constructor assignables
- more work on RAC default bin
- uniqueify \label variables
- use of \lbl on subexpressions can change evaluation order; perhaps also \old
- Problem with //@deprecated comments
- OPtion problems
  - -deprecation in JML
  - -d if dir does not exist
  -source
  -verbose
  @filename
  
Old Notes - plugin
- syntax highlighting in comments
- as you type semantic highlighting
- marker creation
- quick fixes
- create default spec
- integrate jmlunit
- integrate Daikon
- inserting suggested specs to correct problems
- insert a non-null
- show VCs, Counterexamples in a user-friendly way
- help in proving
- navigate to associated decls
- Race condition on saving editors - between builder & ESC when ESCing individual functions and the file is not saved
- Display of JML proof information
- GUI logging out of order (std vs. error)
- Logging of SMT errors
- Usability: showing counterexample, asking for proof information
- Make trace functionality the default
- ESC & casting
- ESC on Mac
- List JML as a Category under appearance

ToDo:
- Multidimensional arrays
- Array initializers
- \fresh
- strings
- errors in field initializers, initializers
- using initializers as part of constructors

To fix for release

- better handling of strings
- invariants in RAC?
- tracing
- quantifiers for static methods, invariants

Fix
- tracing: contents of \old does not work quite right 
- review foreach loops once more
- better error message for yices2 and quantifiers
- better error message for CVC4 and non-linear constructs
- cancel jobs in the Plugin stop method - use job families
- use a WorkspaceRunnable for resource changes
- what other things need Invariants assumed/checked
- what about invariants of parents of type variables
- fix default assignable for constructors
- new arrays inside JML expressions, especially quantifiers
- problems with quantified expressions as invariants in RAC

Soon
- loop modifies, and general block modifies
- interface between UI and tool
- demo files
- preferences for feasibility
- fix Z3 command arguments

Tracing issues
- insert constants for newly allocated objects (from new)
- report no method or new value if the method or constructor throws an exception
- show chars as characters?

Integer types
- need to assume value ranges
- need to check for overflows

Strings
- need fresh semantics on the output
- need determinism
- need to debug testStringLength3

Output
- give assertion warnings with more explanation
- other half of associated location information

Education issues
- Warnings about JML subsets

Loop issues:
- formulation problem in escTraceDo
- problem with display of expressions that are used more than once (like loop invariants and variants); might be true of callee preconditions, replicated method preconditions
- havoc computation needs review - do a loop modifies check

Recent issues:
- need UI for feasibility checks
- reorganize postcondition checks to allow checking feasibility of spec cases

- Check that ESC on a method without typechecking or with bad typecheck is OK
- visibility of default assignable this.* for constructors
- require at least one spec case at method visibility
- enforce strictness of clause ordering?
- need a check for undefined pure methods
- denested specs are causing multiple evaluations
- pure methods are supposed to be deterministic
- transitive, final subtype relationships
- test showing control flow for all statement types
- test getting values for all expression types
- finish fixing java types of generic types
- trying to show specs for a method that is not typechecked complains - should just do the typechecking

- ESC on method can have NPE if no typecheck completed
- when old is used, values shown have encoded names

Plug-in
- Review
    use of Timer
    use of uiverboseness
    review when runtime library is added/removed
    review Utils.java, OpenJMLInterface, JmlEclikpseProblem, ProblemRequestor, JMLBuilder
    fix errorlog mechanisms
    enhance SolversPage
    change all uses of errorlog to error dialog boxes?
    review JMLBuilder and building routines
    clean up context menu items
    review SolversPage.java
    unify ChoiceDialog, EnumDialog; add Title
- implement feasibility checks
- implement feasibility check at a specific place
- would like to report old values for op= assignments and x++
- bug in printing position in the UI
- start position wrong for assert?
- show exception info for catch clauses
- show exception info in the UI? exception highlighting?
- manage multiple proofs, show proof information
- specs editing dialog is modeless, which means that one can add and remove
    from the specs path - but these are not reflected in the specs editing
    dialog until it is regenerated
- change PopupActions to Eclipse 4.2
- PopupActions class names are gratuitously different than MenuActions
- Unify PathsEditor, RACDialog, SolverListEditor   

- sort out menus; update popup menus
- context menu for problems, for Proof view,
- folding in trace view
- update tracing
- menu action for problem view
- when selecting a counterexample, move editor to the designated method
- test proof results with multiple projects
- handle issues with offsets when displaying highlighting or CE values after a file has been edited
- tabs in preferences

- finish callable; apply results to constraint
- issues with multiple callable, accessible, assignable clauses
- document \distinct

- test try with resources, on RAC
- continue or break with intervening finally blocks not implemented
- continue and break with labels
- potentially undefined operations in quantified statements are not handled (likely will crash)
- Rac does not check callee preconditions - actually at present does not translate or check constructors at all
- move to JDK 8


Other:
- RAC constructor
- havoc

To do soon
- constraint
- thisID for invariants in applyHelper
- tracing and counterexamples
- plugin: rac options, tracing, counterexamples

Things to do./check to be up to old implementation

- try packaging solvers
- ESC on MAC
- review api tests and interface
- handling .jml files
- review verbosity, progress monitors
- in nowarn - check that idents are known

Recent stuff - UI
- typechecking a WorkingSet causes tasks to be run in parallel (in different contexts) - and it is not clear from the UI what is happening
- each static check appears to redo all typechecking
- progress when multiple items are selected in plugin
- debug output from OpenJML goes to wrong log
- finish converting debug System.out to log
- options not passed through to OpenJML - have to use args
- options do not update on consecutive ESCs
- editing of paths - a specific src folder is not recognized as in the 'all source folders'
- get rac to work from plugin
- verbosity needs more work (SEND)
- preferences need a little more fixing up
- how to handle .jml files
- how to handle Eclipse reporting errors in .jml files
- estimating work items for .jml files is wrong (may differ from .java and the .jml files are not processed)
- try other solvers
- menu item to generate .jml files
- preferences: roots; remove noInternalSpecs
- incrementality

Other
-- compile style
-- annotations processing
-- generics
