To do soon
- constraint
- thisID for invariants in applyHelper
- tracing and counterexamples
- plugin: rac options, tracing, counterexamples

Things to do./check to be up to old implementation
- static checking of represents
- model fields in RAC and ESC
- check model classes in ESC
- constraint
- RAC checking of represents
- introduce axioms for all mentioned types
- handling constructors
- finish signals_only
- in clause in RAC
- \TYPE in ESC and RAC
- <: operator in ESC and RAC
- recursive calls in specs (ESC)
- implement: \fresh, \nonnullelements, \elemtype, \typeof, \type
- [quantified expressions]
- [new informal expression]
- checks on visibility of identifiers in specification cases, invariants
- Java features in RAC, at least as a pass through

New Java things to document
- switch on enum and String
- enum
- autoboxing
- coveriant return types
- binary literals, underscores in literals
- diamond type inference
- try with resources
- catching multiple exceptions and rethrowing
- (Java 8) lambda expressions
- (Java 8) JSR 308
- (Java 6) classpath wildcards
- (Java 6) compiler API, dependency information

Yet to implement
- enum definition
- switch with enum or String
- break/continue statement does not execute intervening finally blocks
- lock operations, synchronized statement
- unrolling loops
- local classes
- havoc in loops

Yet to test
- continue with label
- dowhile statements with side effects

Things to standardize or discuss
- search algorithm on .jml files
- rules about Java comments embedded in JML
- default for signals_only
- use of ESC RAC DEBUG as standard keys
- cross state comparisons with \old, \pre
- set comprehension issues, type
- \same
- semantics (Visibility) of helper methods
- nullable_by_default vs. non_null_by_default
- optional also, flexible order of clauses

Changes to propose
- example vs. behavior
- choose, choose_if
- \lbl
- otherwise/else
- \index, \values
- query, secret

Recent stuff
- new options: RAC source, Rac check assumptions, Rac display mode, esc Asserts, style of ESC
- old options: --noJML --roots --showbb, --stopIfParseErrors
- get rid of old update site versions
- try packaging solvers
- ESC on MAC
- review api tests and interface
- handling .jml files
- review verbosity, progress monitors
- in nowarn - check that idents are known

Recent stuff - UI
- typechecking a WorkingSet causes tasks to be run in parallel (in different contexts) - and it is not clear from the UI what is happening
- each static check appears to redo all typechecking
- progress when multiple items are selected in plugin
- debug output from OpenJML goes to wrong log
- finish converting debug System.out to log
- options not passed through to OpenJML - have to use args
- options do not update on consecutive ESCs
- editing of paths - a specific src folder is not recognized as in the 'all source folders'
- get rac to work from plugin
- verbosity needs more work (SEND)
- preferences need a little more fixing up
- how to handle .jml files
- how to handle Eclipse reporting errors in .jml files
- estimating work items for .jml files is wrong (may differ from .java and the .jml files are not processed)
- try other solvers
- menu item to generate .jml files
- preferences: roots; remove noInternalSpecs
- incrementality

Other
-- compile style
-- annotations processing
-- generics
-- test locale; more localization

NOTES and TODO items from code reviews and major features

To review:
- everything in OpenJML, JMLAnnotations, Specs, OpenJMLUI except
JmlFlow



To Do:
JmlFlow - implement flow checks for JML statements and expressions
review notes below about OpenJDK

Jmldoc:
- nested model classes are written with fully qualified names and without links to their own pages
- some errors on Enums in generating jmldoc* tests
- model enums
