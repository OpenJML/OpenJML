## This script runs tests on a release build.
## The working directory in running the script is expected to be the OpenJMLTest
## directory of the SVN tree and where the Eclipse test data is located
## (i.e. where this file is kept)

## It tests a build with today's date - i.e. the build just created by
## ./buildRelease

## You should have the appropriate version of Java on your path

## Within Eclipse (in Cygwin at least), the paths that are defined do not work
## here, so we just set them.
