<BODY>

<P> The <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool adds JML specifications to the usual
<CODE>javadoc</CODE> documentation.  The source for that tool is
contained in the <CODE>org.jmlspecs.openjml.jmldoc</CODE> package.
The use and design of the tool are described here. </P>

<P> The <CODE>javadoc</CODE> tool provides HTML pages that
conveniently summarize the API and documentation provided by a set of
source code.  The <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool is an enhancement of
<CODE>javadoc</CODE> that adds to the <CODE>javadoc</CODE>
documentation the JML specifications that are present in the source
code.  The <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool is a drop-in replacement for
<CODE>javadoc</CODE>, with additional functionality and additional
options. </P>

<P> The tool also enhances the <CODE>javadoc</CODE> information by
including any Java programming language annotations associated with a
type, method, or field in the summary of that program element. </P>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<P> The <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool is provided as a zip containing these
files: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><CODE>openjml.jar</CODE> - a jar of the Java classes and
      resources needed to run the tool
  <LI><CODE>jmldoc</CODE> - a bash script that is a convenient driver
      for the tool
  <LI><CODE>README.html</CODE> - this file, containing a description
      of the tool
  <LI><CODE>OpenJDK-LICENSE-INFO</CODE> - the license under which the OpenJDK
      is distributed and, by extension, applies to this jmldoc tool
</UL>

<H2>Use</H2>

<UL>

  <LI>The tool may be executed as a command-line tool.  The tool can be
      executed as follows:
      <UL>
        <LI><CODE>java -classpath openjml.jar org.jmlspecs.openjml.jmldoc.Main <I>options-and-files-and-package-names</I></CODE>
      </UL>
  <LI>The options are given in the usual style of a option name (that starts with
      a <CODE>-</CODE> character and may have an argument); the non-option
      arguments are paths (absolute or relative to the current working directory)
      of files or are names of packages that are rooted in one of the sourcepath
      directories.
  <LI>The tool parses source code conforming to Java 1.6 but can be executed
       using Java 1.5 tools and runtime environment.
  <LI>The tool may be executed programmatically by calling the method 
      <CODE>org.jmlspecs.openjml.jmldoc.Main.execute</CODE>
  <LI>All of the options recognized by <CODE>javadoc</CODE> are valid for 
      <CODE>jmldoc</CODE>.  In addition,
      <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> recognizes these options (also reported by the 
      <CODE>-help</CODE> option).
  <LI>FIXME - improve the description of how to handle runtime classes
      <UL>
        <LI><CODE>-specspath</CODE>: the argument to this option is the
            path (in classpath form) in which to search for
            specification files.  The specification path is determined
            by the first of these that is present:
            <UL>
              <LI> CHECK THIS !!!!! FIXME
              <LI>the <CODE>-specspath</CODE> command-line option
              <LI>the <CODE>-Dorg.jmlspecs.specspath=</CODE> option to the java execution
              <LI>the <CODE>-sourcepath</CODE> command-line option
              <LI>the <CODE>-classpath</CODE> command-line option
              <LI>the <CODE>-Djava.class.path=</CODE> option to the java execution
              <LI>the value of the <CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE>
                  environment variable at the time the java execution begins
            </UL>
        <LI><CODE>-dir</CODE>: the argument to this option is a file-system path
            to a directory; any java files found in this directory or its 
            subdirectories (recursively) are included as if they had been
            listed individually on the command-line (the argument may also be
            a file name, in which case it is included as is)
        <LI><CODE>-dirs</CODE>: this option indicates that the following 
            command-line arguments are either file or directory names, up to
            an argument that begins with a <CODE>-</CODE> sign
        <LI><CODE>-noInternalSpecs</CODE>: the jar file containing the
            executable also contains a basic set of specifications of
            core library classes (such as classes in
            <CODE>java.lang</CODE>).  By default those specifications
            are appended to the end of the specification path defined
            above.  If the <CODE>-noInternalSpecs</CODE> option is
            given, then these internal specs will not be added.  The
            user will then need to supply an alternate set of
            specifications of basic library classes.
        <LI><CODE>-noInternalRuntime</CODE>: The openjml tools require
            some classes (e.g.  those in the
            <CODE>org.jmlspecs.lang</CODE> package) to be available at
            runtime.  These are added by default to the end of the
            classpath.  If the <CODE>-noInternalRuntime</CODE> option
            is given, these classes are not added to the classpath;
            the user will need to supply those manually.
        <LI><CODE>-noCheckSpecsPath</CODE>: By default, a warning is
            issued if a directory on the specification path does not
            exist.  If the <CODE>-noCheckSpecsPath</CODE> option is
            given, non-existent directories on the specs path are
            silently ignored.

<H2>Known Bugs</H2>

The following are known issues with the <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> output.
<UL>
  <LI>no HTML pages are generated for model classes and interfaces
  <LI>Some JML elements are not listed for classes that do not have
      any corresponding Java elements (e.g. ghost fields are not
      listed if there are no Java fields).
  <LI>spurious errors occur for model enum declarations
  <LI>The JML elements do not obey the javadoc visibility command-line
      options
  <LI>The JML elements do not appear in the index, use
      (cross-reference) pages, deprecated API description, or class
      hierarchy tree
  <LI>The pretty-printing of specifications needs cleanup
  <LI>JML specifications expressed as Java annotations are displayed
      both in the JML specifications and in the Java signatures (along
      with other annotations); however, JML specifications expressed
      as classic JML-style comments only appear in the JML
      specifications and not as annotations.
  <LI>The jmldoc application presumes that the code being documented
      parses without error.

<H2>Design Description</H2>

<H3>OpenJML</H3>

The <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool is an extension of the OpenJDK source
code.  Consequently it parses Java 1.6 code and handles Java 1.7 in so
far as it is implemented in OpenJDK (as of this writing
<CODE>jmldoc</CODE> is built on build ???FIXME of OpenJDK).

<P> In so far as possible, <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> is a pure extension of
the <CODE>javadoc</CODE> tool in OpenJDK.  Some changes to the code of
<CODE>javadoc</CODE> were required: some visibility modifiers were
changed to <CODE>protected</CODE> or <CODE>public</CODE> where the
modified elements were needed in derived classes.  MORE????

<H3>Current design</H3>

The <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool has to combine functionality from two
sources: the openjml tool to parse the specifications associated with
Java program elements and the javadoc tool to output the desired HTML
pages.  These two tools enter program elements into symbol tables
differently (openjml uses the techniques supplied by the OpenJDK Java
compiler); it would require a maintenance-intensive merging of the two
implementations into a third one to use these tools directly.
Instead, <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> uses the OpenJDK facility of independent,
co-existing compilation contexts.  The Java code is parsed and
represented using javadoc, then parsed and separately represented
using openjml, and then, information from the openjml JML
specifications is added into the <CODE>javadoc</CODE> HTML pages as
those HTML pages are generated. This approach has only a few minor
drawbacks: the code is parsed twice; symbol table entries from one
compilation context have to be translated into the other context; and
the Javadoc Doc structure does not actually contain JML elements such
as model fields, methods, and classes.

<P> The <CODE>Main</CODE> class that contains the entry points for the
<CODE>jmldoc</CODE> tool could, corresponding to the discussion above,
derive from either the <CODE>Main</CODE> class of openjml or the 
<CODE>Main</CODE> class of
javadoc.  Since openjml requires more tool initialization, it was more
convenient to derive <CODE>jmldoc</CODE>'s <CODE>Main</CODE> from
openjml's.  Command-line options that <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> adds to
<CODE>javadoc</CODE> are processed in <CODE>Main</CODE> and help
information is provided by the <CODE>JmlStart</CODE> class.

<P> In order to generate JML information in the HTML output, the
current <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> implementation extends the javadoc source
code as follows.  Javadoc operates by executing a set of Writers for
various program elements.  These have interfaces
(e.g. <CODE>ClassWriter</CODE>) and specific implementations
(e.g. <CODE>ClassWriterImpl</CODE>).  In order to reuse as much code
as possible so that the maintenance of <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> as
<CODE>javadoc</CODE> evolves is minimized, the <CODE>jmldoc</CODE>
tool implemented its own set of writers
(e.g. <CODE>ClassWriterJml</CODE>) that extend the corresponding
javadoc writers.  Thus the classes </CODE>ClassWriterJml</CODE>,
<CODE>FieldWriterJml</CODE>, <CODE>MethodWriterJml</CODE>,
<CODE>ConstructorWriterJml</CODE>, and
<CODE>NestedClassWriterJml</CODE> were created.

<P> Javadoc instantiates these writers using a writer factory,
<code>WriterFactoryImpl</code>, which is an implementation of the
interface <code>WriterFactory</code>.  In order to have the various
JML writers instantiated at the correct time, <CODE>jmldoc</CODE> has
its own implementation of <CODE>WriterFactory</CODE>, namely,
<CODE>WriterFactoryJml</CODE>.  The <code>WriterFactoryImpl</code>
class is not written to be extended, so <CODE>WriterFactoryJml</CODE>
is a direct implementation of <code>WriterFactory</code>, at the cost
of duplicating code from <CODE>WriterFactoryImpl</CODE>.

<P> Javadoc instantiates the <CODE>WriterFactory</CODE> in a
<CODE>Configuration</CODE> object.  Javadoc's implementation of
<CODE>Configuration</CODE> (an abstract class) is
<CODE>ConfigurationImpl</CODE>.  Jmldoc extends
<CODE>ConfigurationImpl</CODE> as <CODE>ConfigurationJml</CODE> in
order to instantiate a WriterFactoryJml</CODE> instead of a
<CODE>WriterFactoryImpl</CODE>.  This class also supplies a version
string giving the date of the build represented by the tool.

<P> The <code>Configuration</code> object used to generate the
<code>WriterFactory</code> is instantiated as a singleton object.
Consequently in order that the tool use a
<code>ConfigurationJml</code> object instead of javadoc's
<code>ConfigurationImpl</code>, the singleton is instantiated and
initialized in <CODE>Main</CODE>, before other initialization code has
a chance to create the <code>ConfigurationImpl</code> alternative.

<P> Note that in this design, the standard javadoc doclet is still
used.

<H3>Potential alternate design</H3>

This section describes an alternate, possibly future, design of
<CODE>jmldoc</CODE>.  This alternate design appears to be more aligned
with the design of <CODE>javadoc</CODE> and its provision for doclet
extensions, but also required more implementation and more duplication
of <CODE>javadoc</CODE> code (meaning more maintenance as
<CODE>javadoc</CODE> evolves).

<P> The organization of <CODE>javadoc</CODE>'s HTML output is
controlled by an XML resource file
(<CODE>com/sun/tools/doclets/internal/toolkit/resources/doclet.xml</CODE>).
This file is parsed; for each XML element in the document a
corresponding build method is called by reflection.  For example, the
<CODE>doclet.xml</CODE> file specifies that one part of the
description of a <CODE>ClassDoc</CODE> is a <CODE>ClassHeader</CODE>.
To generate the corresponding HTML, the <CODE>buildClassHeader</CODE>
method of <CODE>ClassBuilder</CODE> is called by reflection.

<P> So one means of adding additional information into the HTML is to
provide a different (but largely duplicated) XML description file.  In
order to do that, one would create a new doclet that referenced that
new XML file; the <CODE>BuilderFactory</CODE> and various builders
(e.g. <CODE>ClassBuilder</CODE>) would need to be extended with
methods that responded to XML document items calling for JML
information to be generated.  However, one still would need to extend
(though somewhat differently) the various Writers that were extended
in the previous design.  Thus no work is saved by using the XML
document and a new doclet; in fact, more classes need to be modified
or extended.
