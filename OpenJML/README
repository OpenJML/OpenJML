OpenJML is a completely rewritten JML tool based
on the OpenJDK release of the Java tool set (http://openjdk.java.net).  It is
an extension of the GPL source available through OpenJDK.  The source code for
OpenJML is kept at sourceforge (see www.openjml.org, www.jmlspecs.org, 
sourceforge.net/projects/jmlspecs/, and
http://jmlspecs.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jmlspecs/OpenJML/ ); documentation
about OpenJML is available at http://www.openjml.org.
Currently OpenJML is consistent with Java 1.8.

The OpenJML tool is a 
- JML syntax and semantics checker
- an implementation of static checking for Java + JML
- an implementation of runtime assertion checking for Java + JML
It includes a Eclipse plug-in interface that allows working with JML
specifications within a Java development tool set.

Additional tools such as a JML documentation generator and test case generator
are contemplated but not yet implemented.

Your feedback regarding the value of this tool is welcome; please report any
difficulties or bugs, to jmlspecs-interest@lists.sourceforge.net or
jmlspecs-reloaded@lists.sourceforge.net or 
jmlspecs-developers@lists.sourceforge.net as appropriate.

The various releases of the tool, the status of development, the Eclipse plugin,
and documentation about how to use the tool
can be obtained from http://www.openjml.net.
