<title>RESOLVE Modeling Types</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
This package is a collection of types with immutable objects based on
the RESOLVE specification language's mathematical models.
An object is <em>immutable</em> if it has no
time-varying state.  The methods defined for objects of such types
thus return other objects instead of making changes in place, as would
occur for a mutable object.
This package also contains enumerators (which are mutable) for the
types of immutable collections in the package.
</p>

<p>
The types of the immutable objects in this package are all
<em>pure</em>, meaning that none of their specified methods have any
user-visible side-effects (although a few inherited from
{@link java.lang.Object} do have side effects).  Their pure methods,
are designed for use in JML specifications.
When using such methods you have to do something with the result
returned by the method, as in functional programming.
The original object's state is never changed by a pure method.
</p>

<p>
For example, to insert an element, <em>e</em>, into a set, <em>s</em>,
one might execute <em>s</em><kbd>.insert(</kbd><em>e</em><kbd>)</kbd>,
but this does not change the object <em>s</em> in any way;
instead, it returns a set that contains all the old elements of
<em>s</em> as well as <em>e</em>.  Don't worry about the time and
space used to do make such a set --
remember that specifications are not mainly designed to be executed.
If you're worried about efficiency, you aren't using the right frame
of mind.
</p>

<p>
The enumerator types
are mutable objects and some of their methods are not pure.
These impure methods can't be used in specifications in JML.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
There are several kinds of types in this package.  These are described below.
</p>

<h3>Kinds of CompareTo</h3>

The interface 
<a href="CompareTo.html"><kbd>CompareTo</kbd></a>
and its subtypes
(such as 
<a href="AntisymmetricCompareTo.html"><kbd>AntisymmetricCompareTo</kbd></a>,
<a href="PreorderedCompareTo.html"><kbd>PreorderedCompareTo</kbd></a>, etc.)
represent different assumptions about a type's compareTo operator.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the {@link java.lang.Comparable} interface, these interfaces
have a compareTo operation that can throw an
<a href="UndefinedException.html"><kbd>UndefinedException</kbd></a>
when the comparison between objects (of appropriate types) is undefined.
This allows the specification of partial orders.
On the other hand, the <kbd>compareTo</kbd> operation of the type
<a href="TotalCompareTo.html"><kbd>TotalCompareTo</kbd></a>
 and its subtypes cannot throw this exception.
</p>

<p>
The type 
<a href="TotallyOrderedCompareTo.html"><kbd>TotallyOrderedCompareTo</kbd></a>
is essentially equivalent
to {@link java.lang.Comparable}.

<p>
See the <a href="package-tree.html">package tree</a> diagram
(in the generated javadocs) for the details of the relationships among
these interfaces.
</p>

<h3>Collections</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most useful model types are the various kinds of
collections. (We use the term ``collection'' in a generic way,
since these types do not implement the {@link java.util.Collection}
interface, because that assumes collections are mutable objects.)
</P>

<h3>Primitive types</h3>

<p>
The type 
<a href="NaturalNumber.html"><kbd>NaturalNumber</kbd></a>
models infinite precision natural numbers.
</p>

<h4>Object collections</h4>

<p>
The type 
<a href="StringOfObject.html"><kbd>StringOfObject</kbd></a>
models finite mathematical strings (i.e., sequences) of objects.
The elements of a string are object
references. When an object is inserted into such a string, it is not
cloned.  The equality test used by the has method uses Java's <kbd>==</kbd>
operator to compare addresses of these objects.
</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>

<p>
The code relies heavily on the org.jmlspecs.models package, whenever
possible.
</p>

<p>
In the test data classes (the <kbd>_JML_TestData.java</kbd> files), we take
advantage of the fact that the types are pure to speed up the
JUnit-based testing.  We also sometimes take advantage of the fact
that other test data, particularly of type Object and JMLType are
either not mutated by the tests or are actually immutable objects.  (Note
that <kbd>new Object()</kbd> produces a new immutable object!)
Typically, the tests don't call any methods on the objects in the
collections that would mutate them, so this is okay.
</p>

The source code for this package uses the GNU Lesser General Public
License, since it is part of the JML runtime libraries.

<p>
These types were designed by Gary T. Leavens in collaboration with
Stephen Edwards, Murali Sitaraman, and their students.
The specifications are primarily based on the work of William Ogden,
in particular his notes for CIS 680 at the Ohio State University.
