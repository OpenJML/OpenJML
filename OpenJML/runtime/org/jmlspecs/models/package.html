<title>JML Modeling Types</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<p>
This package is a collection of types with immutable objects; it also
enumerators (which have mutable objects) for the types of the
immutable collections 
in the package.  An object is <em>immutable</em> if it has no
time-varying state.  The methods defined for objects of such types
thus return other objects instead of making changes in place, as would
occur for a mutable object.</p>

<p>
The types of the immutable objects in this package are all
<em>pure</em>, meaning that none of their specified methods have any
user-visible side-effects (although a few inherited from
{@link java.lang.Object} do have side effects).  Their pure methods,
are designed for use in JML specifications.
When using such methods you have to do something with the result
returned by the method, as in functional programming.
The original object's state is never changed by a pure method.
</p>

<p>
For example, to insert an element, <em>e</em>, into a set, <em>s</em>,
one might execute <em>s</em><kbd>.insert(</kbd><em>e</em><kbd>)</kbd>,
but this does not change the object <em>s</em> in any way;
instead, it returns a set that contains all the old elements of
<em>s</em> as well as <em>e</em>.  At first you shouldn't
worry about the time and space used to do make such a set --
remember that specifications are not mainly designed to be executed.
If you're worried about efficiency, you aren't using the right frame
of mind.
(However, there are legitimate reasons to worry about the efficiency
of executing specifications for testing and debugging purposes.)

</p>

<p>
The enumerator types (such as 
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSetEnumerator.html">JMLObjectSetEnumerator</a></kbd>)
are mutable objects and some of their methods are not pure.
These impure methods can't be used in specifications in JML.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
There are several kinds of types in this package.  These include
various kinds of collections, reflections of types in java.lang that
are useful as elements of these collections, and other types useful in
various styles of specification.  These are described below.
</p>

<h3>Collections</h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most useful model types are the various kinds of
collections.  All of the collections implement the interface
<kbd><a href="JMLCollection.html">JMLCollection</a></kbd>.
This interface is different from {@link java.util.Collection},
because that interface assumes collections are mutable objects.
These can be divided into to three broad classes: the ``object'',
``value'', and ``equals'' collections.</P>

<h4>Object collections</h4>

<p>
The <em>object</em> collections contain object references.  These include
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSet.html">JMLObjectSet</a></kbd>, 
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSequence.html">JMLObjectSequence</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectBag.html">JMLObjectBag</a></kbd>, 
and so on. All of these
treat their elements as object references (addresses) and don't care
about the values of these objects. For
example, objects of type
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSet.html">JMLObjectSet</a></kbd> are sets of object
references. When an object is inserted into such a set, it is not
cloned.  The equality test used by the has method uses Java's <kbd>==</kbd>
operator to compare addresses of these objects.
</p>

<h4>Value collections</h4>

<p>
In contrast, the <em>value</em> collections,
such as <kbd><a href="JMLValueSet.html">JMLValueSet</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLValueSequence.html">JMLValueSequence</a></kbd>,
and <kbd><a href="JMLValueBag.html">JMLValueBag</a></kbd>,
contain object values.  The objects
references stored in such a collection are merely representatives of
the corresponding equivalence classes (of all objects with the same
value). For
example, objects of type
<kbd><a href="JMLValueSet.html">JMLValueSet</a></kbd>
are sets of values.
When an object is inserted into such a set, it is
cloned, so that later changes to the object do not affect its value.
The equality test used by the has method uses the <kbd>.equals</kbd> method of
the object's class.
</p>

<p>
To support cloning, all of the value collection types contain elements
that implement the <kbd><a href="JMLType.html">JMLType</a></kbd> interface.
The requirement that the elements of a value collection implement this
interface is an unfortunate limitation of this scheme, which is necessitated by
Java's type system.
</p>

<h4>Equals Collections</h4>

<p>
The ``equals'' collections are hybrids of the object and value
collections.  They are collections of object identities, however, like
the value collections, the
operations all use Java's <kbd>equals</kbd> method to compare
elements.</p>

<p>
These types are inherently unsafe when the elements are mutable,
because if the elements are mutated in ways that change their
equivalence class (i.e., in ways that change the way that they compare
with respect to the <kbd>equals</kbd> method), then the collection can
be changed without invoking any of the elements of the collection.  So
it is best not to use such collections to relate pre- and post-states
of methods, except when the elements are known not to be mutated.
</p>

<h4>Relations and Maps</h4>

<p>The relation and map types come in nine (9) kinds.
These relate either objects or values to either objects or values, and
the objects may be compared using either <kbd>==</kbd> or the
<kbd>equals</kbd> method
For example, <kbd><a href="JMLObjectToValueRelation.html">JMLObjectToValueRelation</a></kbd> relates objects to
values, using <kbd>==</kbd> to compare the left hand side objects, while
<kbd><a href="JMLEqualsToValueRelation.html">JMLValueToObjectRelation</a></kbd>
relates objects to values, but uses the <kbd>equals</kbd> method to
relate all elements.
</p>

<h4>Model Sets</h4>

<p>
The types <kbd><a href="JMLModelObjectSet.html">JMLModelObjectSet</a></kbd> and <kbd><a href="JMLModelValueSet.html">JMLModelValueSet</a></kbd>
are designed for use in JML's set comprehensions.  They provide
methods that return, for a given type, the set of all objects (or values)
that type.  The returned sets can then be filtered
in a set comprehension.  Note, however, that most of these methods are
model methods, and will render assertions that use them nonexecutable.
</p>

<h3>Reflections of java.lang classes</h3>

<p>
Because of the need for types that implement the <kbd><a href="JMLType.html">JMLType</a></kbd>
interface, this package also has reflections of various types in the
<kbd>java.lang</kbd> package that implement the <kbd><a href="JMLType.html">JMLType</a></kbd>
interface.  For example, <kbd><a href="JMLShort.html">JMLShort</a></kbd> is something like
{@link java.lang.Short}, but implements <kbd><a href="JMLType.html">JMLType</a></kbd>.
Other such types are <kbd><a href="JMLInteger.html">JMLInteger</a></kbd>, <kbd><a href="JMLLong.html">JMLLong</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLFloat.html">JMLFloat</a></kbd>, <kbd><a href="JMLDouble.html">JMLDouble</a></kbd>, <kbd><a href="JMLByte.html">JMLByte</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLChar.html">JMLChar</a></kbd>, and <kbd><a href="JMLString.html">JMLString</a></kbd>.
</p>

<p>
The numeric types that reflect types in <kbd>java.lang</kbd>, such as
<kbd><a href="JMLShort.html">JMLShort</a></kbd>, have one other advantage over their counterparts
in <kbd>java.lang</kbd>.  This advantage is that they also have
methods to do arithmetic.  For example, one can add and subtract
objects of types <kbd><a href="JMLShort.html">JMLShort</a></kbd>.

<h3>Types that support various specification styles</h3>

<p>
The type <kbd><a href="JMLInfiniteInteger.html">JMLInfiniteInteger</a></kbd> is useful for specification
&agrave;
la Eric Hehner of time and space properties.
Also useful for such purposes is <kbd><a href="JMLResources.html">JMLResources</a></kbd>.
</p>

<p>
See also the package <kbd>org.jmlspecs.models.resolve</kbd> for types
that support the RESOLVE specification style.
</p>

<h3>Convenience or Abbreviation Types</h3>

<p>
Several types are provided as conveniences and provide ways to shorten
specifications of common idioms.</p>

The type
<kbd><a href="JMLArrayOps.html">JMLArrayOps</a></kbd>
provides a operations to search for and count elements in arrays,
using either <kbd>==</kbd> or the <kbd>equals</kbd> method for
comparisons to the elements.</p>

The type
<kbd><a href="JMLNullSafe.html">JMLNullSafe</a></kbd>
provides a static method that can perform <kbd>equals</kbd> on two
objects that may be null. It also has methods that
perform a <kbd>toString</kbd> or <kbd>hashCode</kbd> call
on a possibly null object, returning a sensible result.
</p>

<h2>Specification Style</h2>

<p>
These types are intended to be bullet-proof; i.e., they are not
designed for trusted clients.  The reason is to help ensure the
semantics of normal logic in assertion evaluation.  That is, when a
method's precondition is not met, an exception must
be thrown, so that tools have a chance to catch the exception.
Often this exception is actually specified behavior of the type,
although for certain kinds of non null arguments and for some
finiteness issues it suffices to make sure that the code will signal
an exception, as opposed to specifying it.
</p>

<p>
The types are also intended to be used by both JML and ESC/Java.
The reason for this is that we have used ESC/Java to help debug the
specifications and implementations, and also that clients of these
types might like to use ESC/Java.  To this end the specifications
contain some amount of redundancy (over and above the use of
implications and examples).
One of the ways that this shows up is in the use of the JML-only
annotation markers of the form
</kbd>//+@</kbd>
and <kbd>/*+@ ... @+*/</kbd>.
We try to give a complete specification in the these annotations.
The annotations marked by
</kbd>//@</kbd>
and <kbd>/*@ ... @*/</kbd>
are intended mostly for ESC/Java. Some of these are quite redundant
with the JML specifications, but not from the point of view of
ESC/Java.
We have tried to use <kbd>non_null</kbd> annotations in many cases
to avoid some of this redundancy (although technically that still
introduces some redundancy).
We also use ESC/Java's <kbd>nowarn</kbd> pragmas in a few places, so
that the code checks without any warnings.
</p>

<h2>Coding and the Makefiles</h2>

<p>
The main problem of coding in this package is how to avoid duplication
between similar object, value, and equals types, for example between
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSet.html">JMLObjectSet</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLValueSet.html">JMLValueSet</a></kbd>, and
<kbd><a href="JMLEqualsSet.html">JMLEqualsSet</a></kbd>.
The way this is done is by coding these types once, and using a
<kbd>sed</kbd> script to make the object, value, and equals versions of a type.
For example, 
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSet.html">JMLObjectSet</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLValueSet.html">JMLValueSet</a></kbd>, and
<kbd><a href="JMLEqualsSet.html">JMLEqualsSet</a></kbd>
are generated by the file <kbd>JMLSet.java-generic</kbd> using the
script <kbd>JMLSet.sh</kbd>.
This script also generates the related enumeration types:
<kbd><a href="JMLObjectSetEnumerator.html">JMLObjectSetEnumerator</a></kbd>,
<kbd><a href="JMLValueSetEnumerator.html">JMLValueSetEnumerator</a></kbd>, and
<kbd><a href="JMLEqualsSetEnumerator.html">JMLEqualsSetEnumerator</a></kbd>.
Similarly, <kbd><a href="JMLObjectBag.html">JMLObjectBag</a></kbd>
<kbd><a href="JMLValueBag.html">JMLValueBag</a></kbd>, and
<kbd><a href="JMLEqualsBag.html">JMLEqualsBag</a></kbd>
are generated by the file <kbd>JMLBag.java-generic</kbd> using the
script <kbd>JMLBag.sh</kbd>.
This script also generates the related bag enumeration types.
Fragments of code that must be different in each type are defined
using one of the strings in the <kbd>sed</kbd> script.
Thus, it is important, when making changes to these types, to change
the <kbd>.java-generic</kbd> file, instead of the generated
<kbd>.java</kbd> files.  The <kbd>Makefile</kbd> is designed to make the
generated files read-only to prevent editing the wrong files.
</p>

<p>
Following the <kbd>Makefile</kbd>, use <kbd>make generate</kbd> to generate
the files using the scripts.</p>

<p>
To make sure that the pure types are pure, we only use final fields
in the pure types.  However, because the pure types have immutable
objects, we can have <kbd>clone</kbd> return the receiver unchanged
(since the aliasing can't be detected).  Similarly, we play lots of
other tricks with sharing to reduce space usage.  Although time and
space don't matter in some abstract sense, we make some concessions to
efficiency, for the sake of the runtime assertion checker.  However,
when push comes to shove, the most important aspect of these types is
their clarity and correctness.
</p>

<p>
In the test cases (the <kbd>_JML_TestData.java</kbd> files), we take
advantage of the fact that the types are pure to speed up the
JUnit-based testing.  We also sometimes take advantage of the fact
that other test data, particularly of type Object and JMLType are
either not mutated by the tests or are actually immutable objects.  (Note
that <kbd>new Object()</kbd> produces a new immutable object!)
Typically, the tests don't call any methods on the objects in the
collections that would mutate them, so this is okay.

These types were designed by Gary T. Leavens, Clyde Ruby, and Albert
L. Baker, originally.  Others contributing specifications are Curtis
Clifton and Brandon Shilling.  They have been refined under the
supervision of Gary T. Leavens, with help from many JML users,
including Rustan Leino, David Cok, Erik Poll, Jan Dockx, Roy Tan,
and Marko van Doreen.  David Cok in particular has made several
improvements and deserves special thanks for his work; thanks David!
The specification of the enumerators builds on work done for ESC/Java
by Rustan Leino's group at HP SRC (which was Compaq SRC at the time).
