/** Objects that contain values.
 * It is the intention that classes that implement JMLValueType provide a
 * "value semantics" for both clone() and equal(). Equality must be defined
 * by the ".equals()" for any objects contained within an instance of the
 * class. clone() must use the ".clone()" methods of any objects contained in
 * an instance of the class.
 * Hence, classes that implement JMLValueType have objects that are
 * "containers of values", in the sense that the user is interested
 * in the values referenced, not not simply the "addresses".
