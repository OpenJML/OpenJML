     *  <p> A cycle is defined to be the time unit used (in the worst
     *  case) by the fastest source-level instruction in Java code.
     *  When such an instruction is executed, machineCycles increases
     *  by 1.  All other instructions increase machineCycles by an
     *  appropriate amount, sometimes greater than 1.
     *
     *  <p> Multiply machineCycles by the speed of your JVM to get the
     *  time used.  For example, if your JVM executes one cycle every
     *  2 milliseconds, then the number of milliseconds spent in
     *  execution is 2 * machineCycles.
     *
     *  <p>We imagine that the number of machine cycles is infinite
     *  when the program goes into an infinite loop.
