/** Objects that are containers of object references.
 * It is the intention that classes that implement JMLObjectType be
 * "containers of objects", in the sense that the user is only
 * interested in the "object references", (addresses) themselves
 * as the elements in the container. (This is in opposition to 
 * the intention of classes that implement JMLValueType.) With
 * object containers, the object references are copied in operations
 * that create new instances of the container classes, e.g., clone().
 * So there is no "deep copy" made with classes that implement
 * JMLObjectType.
